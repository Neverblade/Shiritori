My version of the Japanese word game.

Supply a word that begins with the last letter of the previously played word.

The more words you play, the less time you get.

Features:

     Starting settings and difficulties (try typing in "hell" as your name for an added challenge).
     Timer system to detect when you've run out of time.
     Sequential leveling system to ramp up difficulty over time.
     Score board to track high scores.
     
     
What I Learned:

     Use of multi-threading to create timers.
     Creating robust input systems to prevent program crashes.
     Reading/writing to text files to use as a pseudo-memory system.
